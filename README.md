# Flashcard Generation

This project aims to generate flashcards from study materials using various question-generation techniques. 

## Folder Structure

**Literature Review**
- Contains research papers reviewed for understanding the state-of-the-art in question generation.
---

**Study-Documents**
- This folder contains input files (PDFs) used for generating questions and answers.
---

**LMQG-library**
- This folder contains the initial implementation using the LMQG library for question generation.
---

**Sample-Generated-Questions**
- Contains example output files from our implementation for reference, showcasing the format of generated questions and answers.
---



## Next Steps
- Enhance the current implementation to support a broader range of inputs and formats.
- Use the provided example outputs in the `Sample-Generated-Questions` folder as a reference for designing the UI for the flashcards.
- Implement flashcard spaced repetition algorithm.
